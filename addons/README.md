#### Easy Game (Beta) for Blender Game Engine

Easy Game is a collection of tools that allow you to work faster and more efficiently with the Blender Game Engine. It it made up of two components:

**Easy Material**

Easy Material creates a physically-plausible photorealistic material template(called uber material). All you have to do is load in the appropriate textures to fill the slots. No more fiddling with materials and texture settings! The materials created by Easy Material are PBR compatible, so you know they'll look great in any lighting condition.

Easy Material supports Diffuse map, Normal map, Gloss/Specular Map, Light map, and Environment Reflection Map. With the right texture packs, Easy Material can make any solid surface look spectacular!

The materials created are useable in the Game Engine as well as Blender Render. Textures not included.


**Easy Asset**

Easy Asset helps you create common game assets such as first-person camera, day-night light cycle, and post-processing effects with just one-click. This way, you can start a project at turbo speed!

The created assets as fully configurable from the Blender Properties Editor or Logic Editor.

Easy Game is under rapid development by me (Mike Pan). I will be updating this tool often in the next few months to bring you the best BGE experience possible. Please let me know how I can improve this tool.
